# Misc Mods

A group of various, unorganized mods that are written by me.

Anything that was originally authored by someone else has been rewritten from the ground up, since I likely wasn't happy with how it was done on a fundamental level.

Everything has been written with performance and stability (nullchecking is hard) as top priorities.

Fully configurable, and turning off stuff will actually prevent it from loading entirely. Multiple config files to support the various aspects.

### IMPORTANT


**If you enable the shmoovement option, it REQUIRES you to add `KinematicCharacterController.dll` to your `HookGenPatcher.cfg` config file! You WILL crash without it!**
